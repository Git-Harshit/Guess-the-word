# Guess-the-word
A simple "Guess the Word" or "Word Completion" Game having a Character-User or Non-Graphical Interface, using Python 2.7x, that hints us for a word with its meaning and a few initials.

The gameplay essentially comprises of 15 questions. Questions may also include bonus questions, which are optional to play after completing the main question, and have no negative marking. Answering all questions is not mandatory and player can input 'n' in place of answer to simply skip the question (without causing any change in their marks) and move on to the next question. All Questions, other than Bonus Questions, have negative markings as well. Marking of each question in the game is fixed as a +10 for every correct answer and a deduction in score with -5 for all wrong answers, and is same for every question throughout the game.

The CUI Game is loaded with rules and a table of all answers which are only accessible for the top scorers. In the game, the answer inputs are compared with case insensitivity so that the correct answers are not treated as incorrect due to any letter capitalisation issues.
